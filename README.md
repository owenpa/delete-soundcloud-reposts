## About the project

One of the easiest ways to learn a new language is to make something with it.
I was never a fan of how SoundCloud disabled the ability to remove reposts from your feed so I decided to add it back.
Once everything is done I will be looking towards getting this extension on the Chrome Web Store for fun.

## Experience this project gave me:

- JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Chrome API
- First ever extension
- Plenty of time spent in the Performance tab of the "Developer Tools" experimenting and reducing the amount of time 
it took to find the reposts and delete them.
