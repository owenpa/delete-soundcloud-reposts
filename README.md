# delete-soundcloud-reposts

Grab the context from every song and remove the ones containing the "soundContext__repost" class.

## About the project

One of the easiest ways to learn a new language is to make something with it.
I was never a fan of how SoundCloud disables the ability to remove reposts from your feed so I decided to add it back.
Once everything is done I will be looking towards getting this extension on the Chrome Web Store for fun.

## Experience this project gave me:

- JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Chrome API
- First ever extension
- Plenty of time spent in the Performance tab of the "Developer Tools" experimenting and reducing the amount of time 
it took to find the reposts and delete them. (from relatively high CPU usage and ~1s down to ~0.1ms)

###### (In the future I will be looking to possibly adding a badge to the icon to display the number of currently removed reposts and saving the configuration options after closing the extension.)
